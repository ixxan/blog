Language is a fundamental part of human culture, shaping our identities, traditions, and ways of thinking. With over 7,000 languages spoken globally, it's concerning that nearly half are endangered <a href="https://www.ethnologue.com" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Visit Ethnologue for more info">[1]</a>.

In the past decade, speech technologies integrated into smartphones and other tech devices have become essential to our daily lives. However, these systems only support a handful of languages. As AI-driven speech systems continue to evolve, the reliance on these limited language systems could deepen the digital divide, further marginalizing underrepresented languages. This is especially concerning for younger generations in minority communities. While immersed in technology from an early age, children may primarily interact with dominant languages, even as families work to preserve their native tongues.

Thus, through this blog, I would like to:
1. Offer a tutorial on the fundamentals of speech technology for those interested
2. Explore recent advancements in speech technology research for low-resource languages
3. Share valuable resources and highlight specific implementations in my native language, Uyghur

By addressing these topics, I hope to inspire further efforts in preserving linguistic diversity and advancing speech technologies that can support a wider range of languages.
